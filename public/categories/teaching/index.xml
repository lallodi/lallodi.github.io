      <description>Courses Offensive Computer Security (2IC80) This is an introductory course on hacking, with a focus on computer networks and software. The full course will revolve around the idea that (most) mechanisms can be illegitimately misused to obtain (some level of) a desired behaviour; this is the very essence of computer security. We will explore network protocols and the implied trust relations they operate upon; we will look at software vulnerabilities and at how they can emerge from software code; we will look at exploit testing and automated attack frameworks; we will look at penetration testing and advanced networked attacks.</description>
